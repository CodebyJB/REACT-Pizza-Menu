# React Pizza Project

Welcome to my first React project! This project demonstrates the use of components, props, and JSX. It showcases a menu of delicious pizzas.

The main features include:

    * Displaying a menu of different pizzas.
    * Each pizza is represented as a separate component.
    * Pizza information such as name, ingredients, price, and availability is passed to the components using props.
    * The menu dynamically renders the pizza components based on the provided data.
